description: Get started with gill, the new JavaScript client for Solana developers.
---

Gill is a modern javascript/typescript client library for interacting with the
[Solana](http://solana.com/) blockchain. You can use it to build Solana apps in NodeJS, web
browsers, React Native, and just about any other JavaScript environment.

Gill is built on top of the Solana JavaScript libraries built by Anza:
[@solana/kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit) (formerly known as "web3.js v2"). By utilizing the
same types and functions under the hood, `gill` is compatible with `@solana/kit`. All `@solana/kit`
imports can even be directly replaced with `gill` for one-to-one compatibility, plus unlocking the
various quality-of-life improvements that gill provides.

## Install gill

Install the core `gill` library in your project:

```package-install
gill
```

<Callout title="Coming from Kit?">
  All imports from the `@solana/kit` library can be directly replaces with `gill` to achieve the
  exact same functionality. Plus unlock the additional functionality only included in gill, like
  `createTransaction`.
</Callout>

## Quick start

After [installing gill](#install-gill), follow these simple steps to install and get started with
the `gill` library:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a Solana RPC connection

Create a Solana `rpc` and `rpcSubscriptions` client connection from any RPC URL or standard Solana
network moniker (i.e. `devnet`, `localnet`, `mainnet` etc).

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "mainnet",
});
```

The above snippet demonstrates how to use the public Solana RPC endpoints. These are great for quick
local testing, but they are (rightfully) subject to heavy rate limits.

When you are ready to ship your application to production, you will need to utilize a production
ready RPC provider.

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "https://private-solana-rpc-provider.com",
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Make Solana RPC requests

After you have a Solana `rpc` connection, you can make all the
[JSON RPC method](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) calls directly off of it.

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

// get slot
const slot = await rpc.getSlot().send();

// get the latest blockhash
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

<Callout>
  The `rpc` client requires you to call `.send()` on the RPC method in order to actually send the
  request to your RPC provider and get a response.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a transaction

You can easily create transactions using the `createTransaction()` function. It accepts a single
object argument that is fully typed for all the required (and optional) pieces of a Solana
transaction.

When creating a Solana transaction, you will need several pieces of information:

- version - `legacy` works well for every task, unless you need Address Lookup Tables (then use `0`)
- latest blockhash - This is like a recent timestamp check that the blockchain uses. Simply request
  it from your `rpc`.
- instructions - Instructs the Solana runtime which programs and logic to execute onchain.
- fee payer - The signer that will cover the small fee collected by the network to execute the
  transaction.

<Callout>
  For simplicity, the following examples utilize `loadKeypairSignerFromFile()` to load a Solana
  keypair file from the local file system. Specifically the Solana CLI's default file path:
  `~/.config/solana/id.json`. This can work well for running local scripts, but not for frontend
  applications where users will need to sign using their wallets. See [Creating a signer without a
  secret key](/docs/getting-started/signers#create-a-signer-without-the-secret-key) for details.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { createTransaction, createSolanaClient } from "gill";
import { loadKeypairSignerFromFile } from "gill/node";
import { getAddMemoInstruction } from "gill/programs";

/**
 * load the Solana CLI's default keypair file (`~/.config/solana/id.json`)
 * as a signer into your script
 */
const signer = await loadKeypairSignerFromFile();

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();

const transaction = createTransaction({
  version: "legacy", // or `0` if using address lookup tables
  feePayer: signer,
  instructions: [
    getAddMemoInstruction({
      memo: "gm world!",
    }),
  ],
  latestBlockhash,
  // computeUnitLimit, // optional, but highly recommend to set
  // computeUnitPrice, // optional, but highly recommend to set
});
```

In the example above, we are loading a signer from the local file system to act as our fee payer and
only signer. The transaction itself has a single "memo instruction" in it to log a simple message
onchain.

You can now [sign the transaction](#signing-transactions) and send it to the blockchain for
confirmation.

<Callout title="Optimizing transactions">
  You can (and should) optimize your Solana transactions by including a compute unit limit and
  compute unit price instructions within your transaction. The `createTransaction()` function
  supports easily adding these instructions via the `computeUnitLimit` and `computeUnitPrice`
  arguments.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Signing transactions

Once you have a transaction that is ready to be signed, you can call
`signTransactionMessageWithSigners()` to perform the signing operations with all the available
signers. This function will also assert that the transaction is fully signed.

<Callout type="warn">
  If your transaction cannot be fully signed at this time (because you only have some of the signers
  available and attached), you can call `partiallySignTransactionMessageWithSigners()` to partially
  sign the transaction. Then the remaining signatures can be added later.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import {
  createTransaction,
  createSolanaClient,
  signTransactionMessageWithSigners,
} from "gill";

const { rpc, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "devnet",
});

// ... [other business logic here]

const transaction = createTransaction({...});

const signedTransaction = await signTransactionMessageWithSigners(transaction);

const signature = getSignatureFromTransaction(signedTransaction);
```

After a transaction has been signed by the `feePayer`, you can obtain its transaction signature
using the `getSignatureFromTransaction()` function (yes, even before sending it to the network).

Once you have a fully signed transaction, `signedTransaction` in the example above, you can now send
it to the blockchain network for confirmation.

</Step>

<Step>

### Send and confirm transactions

When your transaction is ready and signed, you can send it to the network via your RPC provider
using the `sendAndConfirmTransaction()` function initialized via gill's `createSolanaClient()`:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import {
  createTransaction,
  createSolanaClient,
  signTransactionMessageWithSigners,
} from "gill";

const { rpc, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "devnet",
});

// ... [other business logic here]

const transaction = createTransaction({...});

const signedTransaction = await signTransactionMessageWithSigners(transaction);

const signature = getSignatureFromTransaction(signedTransaction);

try {
  console.log("Sending transaction:", signature);

  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(signedTransaction);

  console.log("Transaction confirmed!");
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Unable to send and confirm the transaction");
  console.error(err);
}
```

<Callout>
  The `sendAndConfirmTransaction()` function performs a check to ensure all required signatures are
  present (aka the transactions is "fully signed") before attempting to send it to the network. If
  any signatures are missing, it will throw an error.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Congratulations! You now understand the basics of using the `gill` library to perform create and
send Solana transactions.
