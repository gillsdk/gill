title: React Hooks for Solana
description: A React hooks library for easily interacting with the Solana blockchain, built on top of gill
---

Welcome to `gill-react`, a React hooks library for easily interacting with the [Solana](http://solana.com/) blockchain.

<Callout type="info">
  `gill-react` is in active development. All APIs are subject to change until reaching the first major version (v1.0.0).
</Callout>

This React hooks library is built on top of two core libraries:

1. [`gill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gill) - modern JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
2. [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query) - popular and powerful asynchronous state management for React.

## Installation

Install `gill-react` with your package manager of choice:

```package-install
gill gill-react @tanstack/react-query
```

<Callout>
  `gill` and `@tanstack/react-query` are peer dependencies of `gill-react` so you need to explicitly install them. This allows you have more control over managing dependencies yourself.
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **Type-safe hooks** - Full TypeScript support with proper typing for all Solana data
- **Built on TanStack Query** - Leverages the power of React Query for caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates
- **Easy to use** - Simple, intuitive API that follows React best practices
- **Server component ready** - Works with Next.js and other React Server Component frameworks
- **Lightweight** - Minimal bundle size with tree-shaking support

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { lamportsToSol } from "gill";
import { useBalance } from "gill-react";

export function WalletBalance({ address }: { address: string }) {
  const { balance, isLoading, isError, error } = useBalance({ address });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (isError) return <div>Error: {error?.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Balance: {lamportsToSol(balance)} SOL</p>
    </div>
  );
