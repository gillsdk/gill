  Collection of example scripts and code snippets on how to use gill, the Solana JavaScript SDK.
---

Listed here and in gill's open source repository, you can find a collection of example scripts and
code snippets that demonstrate how to accomplish various common tasks for Solana developers.

[github.com/gillsdk/gill/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/tree/master/examples)

## Get started with the basics

Inside of the gill repository, you can find the `get-started` directory that contains gill examples
scripts on the following:

### intro.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/intro.ts
</Callout>

A brief introduction to the `gill` library. Demonstrating and explaining the commonly used tasks
involved to interact with the Solana blockchain, including:

- load a keypair signer from the local filesystem
- create an rpc connection to the blockchain
- creating basic instructions (like the memo instruction)
- getting the latest blockhash
- building a complete transaction
- signing the transaction with the loaded local keypair signer
- getting the signature of a transaction (even before it is sent)
- logging Solana Explorer links
- sending and confirming a transaction

These are all the most basic tasks required for any application sending transaction to the Solana
blockchain.

### airdrop.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/airdrop.ts
</Callout>

Demonstrates how to create a client connection to the Solana blockchain on a test cluster (e.g.
`devnet`, `testnet`, or `localnet`) and request airdrops of testing SOL tokens to a wallet address.

### tokens.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/tokens.ts
</Callout>

Demonstrates how to use gill's "transaction builders" to create a brand new Solana token (with
onchain metadata) and then mint tokens to another user's wallet:

- load a keypair signer from the local filesystem
- create an rpc connection to the blockchain
- getting the latest blockhash
- build an optimized transaction to create a token
- sign, send, and confirm that "create token" transaction
- build an optimized transaction to mint
- sign, send, and confirm that "mint tokens" transaction

### reference-keys.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/reference-keys.ts
</Callout>

This script demonstrates the process to add a reference key into a transaction.

Adding reference keys to transactions allows developers to be able track the completion of
transactions given to users, without knowing the signature ahead of time. Then, perform any desired
logic after detection of the reference keyed transaction landing onchain.

Most notably utilized within SolanaPay and Blinks.

more information.

### Comparison between @solana/kit and gill

You can find comparison scripts that demonstrates some of the differences between
[gill](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill) and [@solana/kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit) (formerly
known as "web3.js v2").

<Callout>
  Find a more comprehensive comparison in [gill vs @solana/kit comparison
  docs](https://gillsdk.com/docs/compare/kit)
</Callout>

Both scripts accomplish the same task: send an optimized transaction to the Solana blockchain.
