title: gill vs @solana/kit
description:
  "Explore a side-by-side comparison of gill and @solana/kit (formerly known as web3js v2)"
---

The gill library is built directly on top of
[`@solana/kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/kit), the new JavaScript primitives developed
by [Anza](https://anza.xyz) as a more performant replacement for the old
[`@solana/web3.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js). Since Kit only ships these new
low level primitives, developers are forced into a single experience of manually crafting everything
and ballooning their applications with verbose boilerplate.

Gill is able to ship **both** the same low level primitives as Kit **and** lightly opinionated
abstractions to simplify common tasks, all from a single compatible interface. By simplifying across
the board with gill, developers can focus more time on their application's business logic and not
verbose boilerplate.

<Callout>
  `@solana/kit` was formerly know as "web3.js v2" as it was originally published as the version
  `2.x` release of `@solana/web3.js`. Anza engineers noted this to complicate and confuse the
  upgrade path for the new technologies, so they decided to publish under the new package name of
  `@solana/kit`.

You can find the complete scripts that the example code snippets were created from in the gill repo
[here](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/tree/master/examples/get-started#comparison-of-gill-vs-solanakit-aka-web3js-v2).
Both are written with honest intentions, best practices, and attempt to be as concise as possible in
accomplishing the same task.

## Connecting to the blockchain

Every application will need to create a connection to the blockchain. A complete and usable
connection consists of the following three parts (at a minimum):

1. `rpc` - used to send [Solana RPC](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) requests over HTTP (the most
   common way)
2. `rpcSubscriptions` - used to make certain RPC requests over websockets
3. `sendAndConfirmTransaction` - function used to actually send a complete transaction to the
   blockchain for confirmation

The following code snippets demonstrate how to instantiate all three of these connection pieces for
each of the libraries:

```ts tab="gill"
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "devnet",
});
```

```ts tab="@solana/kit"
import {
  devnet,
  createSolanaRpc,
  createSolanaRpcSubscriptions,
  sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory,
} from "@solana/kit";

const rpc = createSolanaRpc(devnet("https://api.devnet.solana.com"));

const rpcSubscriptions = createSolanaRpcSubscriptions(devnet("wss://api.devnet.solana.com"));

const sendAndConfirmTransaction = sendAndConfirmTransactionFactory({
  rpc,
  rpcSubscriptions,
});
```

## Making RPC requests

For both `@solana/kit` and `gill`, making standard Solana RPC requests is the same: use the
previously created `rpc` object.

```ts
// get slot
const slot = await rpc.getSlot().send();

// get the latest blockhash
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

## Loading a signer

There are many different ways to obtain a keypair that is capable of performing the Solana specific
signing operations (aka a "signer"). This will look different for frontend and backend applications.

For local scripts, JavaScript server runtimes (like NodeJS and Bun), and backend applications it's
common to load a keypair from the file system or an ENV variable. The following is how to accomplish
this for both libraries:

```ts tab="gill"
import { loadKeypairSignerFromFile } from "gill/node";

const signer = await loadKeypairSignerFromFile();
```

```ts tab="@solana/kit"
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { homedir } from "node:os";
import { resolve } from "node:path";
import { createKeyPairFromBytes } from "@solana/kit";

const keypairFilePath = "~/.config/solana/id.json";

const resolvedKeypairPath = resolve(keypairFilePath.replace("~", homedir()));

const keypair = await createKeyPairFromBytes(
  Uint8Array.from(JSON.parse(readFileSync(resolvedKeypairPath, "utf8"))),
);
```

Note that `@solana/kit` has no specific functionality for loading keypairs from files or ENV
variables, so developers must implement the file/ENV reading operations themselves.

Whereas gill includes multiple functions to handle these very scenarios:

- [`loadKeypairSignerFromFile()`](/api/gill-node/functions/loadKeypairSignerFromFile)
- [`loadKeypairSignerFromEnvironment()`](/api/gill-node/functions/loadKeypairSignerFromEnvironment)
- [`loadKeypairSignerFromEnvironmentBase58()`](/api/gill-node/functions/loadKeypairSignerFromEnvironmentBase58)

<Callout>
  The `loadKeypairSignerFromFile()` function defaults to the Solana CLI's keypair path
  (`~/.config/solana/id.json`). If you wish to load a different keypair file, provide the path in as
  an argument.
</Callout>

## Creating a transaction

After connecting to the blockchain and making RPC requests, the next most common tasks is actually
creating transactions.

The following are examples of how to create a simple Memo transaction that includes basic
optimizations (via compute budget instructions):

```ts tab="gill"
import { createTransaction } from "gill";
import { getAddMemoInstruction } from "gill/programs";

const transaction = createTransaction({
  version: "legacy",
  feePayer: signer,
  instructions: [
    getAddMemoInstruction({
      memo: "gm world!",
    }),
  ],
  latestBlockhash,
  computeUnitLimit: 5000,
  computeUnitPrice: 1000,
});
```

```ts tab="@solana/kit"
import {
  pipe,
  createTransactionMessage,
  setTransactionMessageFeePayerSigner,
  appendTransactionMessageInstructions,
  setTransactionMessageLifetimeUsingBlockhash,
} from "@solana/kit";
import { getAddMemoInstruction } from "@solana-program/memo";
import {
  getSetComputeUnitLimitInstruction,
  getSetComputeUnitPriceInstruction,
} from "@solana-program/compute-budget";

const transaction = pipe(
  createTransactionMessage({ version: "legacy" }),
  (tx) => setTransactionMessageFeePayerSigner(signer, tx),
  (tx) => setTransactionMessageLifetimeUsingBlockhash(latestBlockhash, tx),
  (tx) =>
    appendTransactionMessageInstructions(
      [
        getAddMemoInstruction({
          memo: "gm world!",
        }),
        getSetComputeUnitLimitInstruction({ units: 5000 }),
        getSetComputeUnitPriceInstruction({ microLamports: 1000 }),
      ],
      tx,
    ),
);
```

Notice that the `@solana/kit` based example above requires manually installing two additional
packages: `@solana-program/compute-budget` and `@solana-program/memo`.

Whereas gill takes a different approach:

- `createTransaction` natively supports setting the same compute budget instructions
- the included Memo program client is directly accessible via the `gill/programs` import path
  without having to manually install the package
