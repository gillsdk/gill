Gill is a heavily typed library to improve developer experience. After completing the
[simple installation guide](/docs#install-gill) to get your Solana application setup, everything
_should_ work out of the box for most common application configurations.

However, there may be some configuration your codebase may require in order to utilize the gill
library and avoid TypeScript issues, either in your editor, runtime, or build time.

<Callout title="Having TypeScript issues?">
  If your codebase is experiencing TypeScript related issues not covered by this document, please
  [open an issue here](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/issues/new?title=%5BTypeScript%5D%20) to
  describe your scenario. Please also include a simple reproduction to aid in troubleshooting by
  this library's maintainers.

## Running \*.ts files with NodeJS

More recent versions of NodeJS support TypeScript natively, either out of the box or requiring using
the `--experimental-strip-types` flag. Allowing you to run `.ts` files using the `node` command.

```shell
node --version
# output: v24.1.0
node ./file.ts
```

However, due to the differences in how NodeJS handles these types you may experience runtime errors
when attempting to run `.ts` files. The following is an example error message you may experience:

```
file:///home/gill/code/file.ts:22
  SolanaClusterMoniker,
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: The requested module 'gill' does not provide an export named 'SolanaClusterMoniker'
```

### Solution

<Steps>

<Step>

Update your project's `tsconfig.json` file to utilize the
[verbatimModuleSyntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#verbatimModuleSyntax) compiler
option. This will ensure your editor and build system will correctly show errors when codes does not
explicitly annotate imported types/interfaces with the `type` keyword.

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

You will then need to update all your `import` statements to annotate which imported symbols are
types by explicitly using the `type` keyword. This is required for all TypeScript types **AND**
interfaces.

For example, `SolanaClusterMoniker` is a type export from `gill`:

```ts
import { createSolanaClient, SolanaClusterMoniker } from "gill";
```

It should be updated to be explicitly imported as a `type` (for both TypeScript's types and
interfaces):

```ts tab="Option 1 (recommended)"
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";
import type { SolanaClusterMoniker } from "gill";
```

```ts tab="Option 2"
import { createSolanaClient, type SolanaClusterMoniker } from "gill";
```

<Callout title="Pro Tip">
  If you declare two different imports from the same library, one with the `type` keyword and one
  without. Most code editors will correct import new types into the "type import" statement when
  performing tab completion. Making it so you do not have to manually add the `type` annotation to
  each individual imported type.
