On Solana, a "reference key" is a unique, single-use, non-signer address that is put inside of a
transaction in order to track its completion on the network. This is a common technique used within
the [Solana Pay](https://docs.solanapay.com/spec#reference) and
[Blockchain Link (Blink)](https://solana.com/solutions/actions) specifications.

Until a Solana transaction is signed by the "fee payer", it does not have a signature; making it
difficult to determine if and when the transaction has landed on-chain. Inserting a reference key
into the transaction allows developers to programmatically call the
[`getSignaturesForAddress`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturesforaddress) RPC method to
determine if the transaction has landed. Triggering any desired business logic in their application.

## Add a reference key to a transaction

Inserting a reference key inside of a transaction can be accomplished by adding the desired address
as a "non-signer" account key in any supporting instruction.

Within gill, there are two functions for inserting reference keys:

1. `insertReferenceKeyToTransactionMessage()` - insert just one reference key
2. `insertReferenceKeysToTransactionMessage()` - insert multiple reference keys

Under the hood, these "insert reference key" functions search the instructions inside the
transaction and manually inserts the reference key address as a non-signer on the
[first supported instruction](#program-errors-due-to-reference-keys).

The following is an example of constructing a transaction using the `createTransaction()` then
inserting the reference key using the "pipe method". This is the most recommended way to perform
this:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import {
  pipe,
  createTransaction,
  generateKeyPairSigner,
  insertReferenceKeysToTransactionMessage,
} from "gill";

// generate a reference key address
const { address: reference } = await generateKeyPairSigner();

const transaction = pipe(
  createTransaction({
    version: "legacy",
    feePayer: signer,
    instructions: [
      getAddMemoInstruction({
        memo: "gm world!",
      }),
    ],
    latestBlockhash,
    // setting a CU limit ensures there is at least one non-memo instruction
    computeUnitLimit: 5000,
  }),
  (tx) => insertReferenceKeysToTransactionMessage([reference], tx),
);
```

The above transaction will have two instructions in it:

1. SPL memo instruction (via the `getAddMemoInstruction` function)
2. compute unit limit instruction (via the `computeUnitLimit` value)

<Callout type="warn" title="At least one non-memo instruction is required">
  To insert a reference key into a transaction, the transaction **must** have at least one non-memo
  instruction. See [Program errors due to reference keys](#program-errors-due-to-reference-keys)
  below for details.
</Callout>

This transaction can be signed and sent to the network. Then anyone can
[monitor for the reference key](#monitoring-for-a-reference-key) and trigger their desired business
logic.

### Add to an existing transaction

If your application is not directly creating the transaction, like when consuming external APIs, you
can still add a reference key to the transaction.

First fetch the transaction from your desired external source, then insert the reference key as
follows:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import {
  createTransaction,
  generateKeyPairSigner,
  insertReferenceKeysToTransactionMessage
} from "gill";

// note: `transaction` is mutable here so we can modify it later to insert the reference key
let { transaction } = await fetchTransactionFromExternalSource(...);

// ... [your other business logic here]

// generate a reference key address
const { address: reference } = await generateKeyPairSigner();

transaction = insertReferenceKeysToTransactionMessage([reference], transaction);
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Notice for already signed transactions">
  If the transaction obtained from an external source or API is already signed, you cannot modify
  the transaction to insert a reference key. Your only option is to wipe the existing signatures,
  insert the reference key, and resign. Or encourage your external API provider to accept a
  reference key input to their API endpoints that return signed transactions.
</Callout>

This transaction can be signed and sent to the network. Then anyone can
[monitor for the reference key](#monitoring-for-a-reference-key) and trigger their desired business
logic.

## Program errors due to reference keys

Some programs on the Solana network do not allow adding additional non-signer accounts due to the
way they are coded. Often times, these programs expect all provided account keys to be writable or a
signer. If they receive additional or unexpected accounts, they will error.

As such, gill's "insert reference key" functions attempt to prevent these errors by skipping
instructions from these programs. The following programs are known to fall into this condition and
are skipped when inserting reference keys:

- `MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr` - SPL memo program

<Callout title="Know of another program?">
  If you locate another commonly used program that results in errors due to inserting additional
  account keys, please [open an
  issue](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/issues?title=%5BReference%20Key%20Program%5D%20) and share
  with the community.
</Callout>

## Monitoring for a reference key

After a reference key has been inserted into a transaction, and that transaction is expected to have
been signed then sent to the network for confirmation, you use the
[`getSignaturesForAddress`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturesforaddress) RPC method to
determine if the transaction has been confirmed.

Using gill's `getOldestSignatureForAddress()` function, we can easily fetch the oldest signature
that includes the reference key. If the reference key is not found, it will throw an error.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { createSolanaClient, address, getOldestSignatureForAddress } from "gill";

const { rpc, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "devnet",
});

const reference = address("...");

try {
  const { signature } = await getOldestSignatureForAddress(rpc, reference);

  const transaction = await rpc.getTransaction(signature).send();

  // ... [validate the `transaction` performed the expected actions on-chain]

  // perform business logic for a successful transaction
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  While you can utilize the raw response from the `getSignaturesForAddress` RPC method, your
  application will need to manually handle recursively fetching signatures until you locate the
  oldest one (i.e. the only one we care about).
</Callout>

Your application can then fetch and process the transaction with the signature returned by
`getOldestSignatureForAddress()`, validating the transaction is as expected.

After your application validates the oldest transaction accomplishes the expected on-chain actions
(e.g. correct token balance changes, etc), you can proceed with any of your "success case" business
logic and handle errors accordingly.

### Security concerns

<Callout type="error" title="Reference keys can be easily spoofed in transactions">
  Due to the architecture of Solana transactions, reference keys can be easily spoofed inside of
  transactions (i.e. anyone can insert them into transactions). Just because your reference key was
  located in a confirmed transaction, does **NOT** mean the transaction is what you expect it to be.
</Callout>

It is crucially important that your application validates the transaction associated with the oldest
signature obtained. Otherwise, your application can be vulnerable to various attacks.
