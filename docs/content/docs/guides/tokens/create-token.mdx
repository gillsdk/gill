title: Create a Token with Metadata
description:
  Learn how to create a new Solana token, with metadata, using the gill JavaScript library.
---

Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of assets. Tokenization
enables the digitalization of property rights. Tokens on Solana are referred to as SPL
([Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-program)) Tokens.

This article will demonstrate [how to create a new SPL token](./create-token) using the
[`gill` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gill), including attaching metadata to the token for
users to see and applications to display.

## Install gill

Install gill using the core `gill` library:

```package-install
gill
```

import { PackageBadges } from "@/components/package-badges";

<PackageBadges packageName="gill" />

## Create an RPC connection

In order to send transactions and/or fetch data from the Solana blockchain, you will need an client
connection. You can easily create a Solana client connection using the `createSolanaClient()`
function.

The `urlOrMoniker` can be either a Solana network moniker (e.g. `devnet`, `mainnet`, `localnet`) or
a full URL of your RPC provider.

```ts twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "devnet", // `mainnet`, `localnet`, etc
});
```

<Callout title="Public RPC endpoints are subject to rate limits">
  Using a Solana moniker will connect to the public RPC endpoints. These are subject to rate limits
  and should not be used in production applications. Applications should find their own RPC provider
  and the URL provided from them.
</Callout>

## Prepare a Signer

Every Solana transaction requires at least one "signer" to be the fee payer for the transaction. The
following are common practices:

- load a signer from a local keypair file (like `~/.config/solana/id.json`, the one used by the
  Solana CLI)
- loading the signer from an ENV variable (e.g. `process.env.SERVER_SIGNER`)
- having a user's wallet be the signer via a front end application

### Load a signer from a local keypair file

For backend scripts and some server environments, you can load a signer from your local filesystem:

```ts twoslash
import { type KeyPairSigner } from "gill";
import { loadKeypairSignerFromFile } from "gill/node";

// This defaults to the file path used by the Solana CLI: `~/.config/solana/id.json`
const signer: KeyPairSigner = await loadKeypairSignerFromFile();
console.log("signer:", signer.address);
```

## Decide which Token Program to use

To use the legacy Token Program:

```ts twoslash
import { TOKEN_PROGRAM_ADDRESS } from "gill/programs";

const tokenProgram = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ADDRESS;
```

To use the Token Extensions Program (aka Token22):

```ts twoslash
import { TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ADDRESS } from "gill/programs";

const tokenProgram = TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ADDRESS;
```

## Generate a Mint and metadata address

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from "gill";

const mint = await generateKeyPairSigner();
```

If you are using the legacy Token Program, you will need to derive the "metadata address" from
Metaplex's Token Metadata program.

```ts twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from "gill";
import { getTokenMetadataAddress } from "gill/programs";

const mint = await generateKeyPairSigner();
const metadataAddress = await getTokenMetadataAddress(mint);
```

## Get the latest blockhash

```ts
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

## Create a transaction that creates a token

<Callout>
  Instead of manually crafting all of these instructions, you can also use gill's instruction
  builder function: `getCreateTokenInstructions()`
</Callout>

```ts
import { createTransaction } from "gill";
import { getMintSize } from "gill/programs";

const space = getMintSize();

const transaction = createTransaction({
  feePayer: signer,
  version: "legacy",
  instructions: [
    getCreateAccountInstruction({
      space,
      lamports: getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(space),
      newAccount: mint,
      payer: signer,
      programAddress: tokenProgram,
    }),
    getInitializeMintInstruction(
      {
        mint: mint.address,
        mintAuthority: signer.address,
        freezeAuthority: signer.address,
        decimals: 9,
      },
      {
        programAddress: tokenProgram,
      },
    ),
    getCreateMetadataAccountV3Instruction({
      collectionDetails: null,
      isMutable: true,
      updateAuthority: signer,
      mint: mint.address,
      metadata: metadataAddress,
      mintAuthority: signer,
      payer: signer,
      data: {
        sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0,
        collection: null,
        creators: null,
        uses: null,
        name: "super sweet token",
        symbol: "SST",
        uri: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-developers/opos-asset/main/assets/Climate/metadata.json",
      },
    }),
  ],
  latestBlockhash,
});
```

## Sign and send the transaction

With your transaction fully created, you can now sign the transaction to

```ts
import { signTransactionMessageWithSigners } from "gill";

const signedTransaction = await signTransactionMessageWithSigners(transaction);

console.log(
  "Explorer:",
  getExplorerLink({
    cluster: "devnet",
    transaction: getSignatureFromTransaction(signedTransaction),
  }),
);
```

If your transaction is already fully signed or has all signer's available, you can send and confirm
it on the blockchain.

```ts
await sendAndConfirmTransaction(signedTransaction);
```

<Callout title="Pro Tip">
  If you do not need to know the transaction signature prior to sending the transaction AND you all
  signers are attached to the transaction, you can pass a fully signable transaction to the
  `sendAndConfirmTransaction()` function initialized from `createSolanaClient()`. It will then
  perform the signing operations prior to sending and confirming.
